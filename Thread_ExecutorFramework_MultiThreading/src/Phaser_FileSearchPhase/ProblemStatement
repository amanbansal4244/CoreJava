Implement an example where three tasks look for files with the extension .log modified in the last 24 hours in three different folders 
and their sub-folders. This task is divided into three steps:
	1. Get a list of the files with the extension .log in the assigned folder and its sub-folders.
	2. Filter the list created in the first step by deleting the files modified more than 24 hours ago.
	3. Print the results in the console. At the end of the step 1 and step 2, we check if the list has any elements or not. 
	   If it hasn't 	any element, the thread ends its execution and is eliminated from the the phaser class.
