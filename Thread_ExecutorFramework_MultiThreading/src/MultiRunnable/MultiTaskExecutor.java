 * Itâ€™s not necessary that each Runnable should be executed in a separate thread. Sometimes,
 *  we need to do multiple jobs in a single thread and each job is instance of Runnable. 
 *  To design this type of solution, a multi runnable should be used. 
 *  This multi runnable is nothing but a collection of runnables which needs to be executed. 
 *  Only addition is that this multi runnable is also a Runnable itself.
 *  
 *  		Below is the list of tasks which needs to be executed in a single thread.
 *  			TaskOne TaskTwo TaskThree
