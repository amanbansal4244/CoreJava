We are going to create user interface like chess and two button : start and stop.
Every single white cell may be empty or their bomb black cell. So there are going to be like 'mine layers' and 'mine sweepers'.
'mine layers' are going to put mines on a given cell and 'mine sweepers' are going to remove mines from a given cell which has mines.
If we start the application(you will see once you start the application), the red cell represents the mines( Basically the mine layers will 
set these mines) and 'mine sweepers' are going to remove mines from a given cell which has mines, thats why pattern is keep changing and changing.

If we click Stop button, board is going to be cleared and we can start again and stop.. so on.

This application is about several mine layer and mine sweeper to a distinct thread. Basically every single 'mine layers' and 'mine sweepers' is 
going to work independently in the sense, they try to put mines on a given cell or they try to get rid of the mines from a given cell
