Out of Date Servers

Consider the file input.txt which contains all information about software installed on various servers in a data center:

Server1, Database, MySQL, 5.5
Server2, Database, MySQL, 5.1
Server3, OS, Ubuntu, 10.04
Server1, OS, Ubuntu, 12.04
Server2, OS, Ubuntu, 12.04
Server3, Language, Python, 2.6.3
This file indicates that Server1, has version 5.5 of MySQL installed, and Server2 has version 5.1 installed, and Server3 has version 10.04 of Ubuntu installed. For the purposes of this program, assume that all version numbers are of the form X.Y or X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are strings of digits.

Write a Java program that reads this file, and prints the number of servers at least one software installation that is not the latest version. Thus, in this case, the output of your program should be:

2

Because 2 servers have out-of-date software (Server 2 contains MySQL 5.1 (which is out of date, because 5.5 is the latest version), and Server 3 contains Ubuntu 10.4) (which is out of date because 12.04 is the latest version))

The program must read input from file input.txt (in the current directory) and write its output to the file output.txt (in the current directory). To save some time, we have already written a basic program which just reads the input into an array of lines, calls a method processData on it, and prints the output. However, currently the processData method doesn't do anything. You have to download this file, save it to a file called Main.java, modify the processData method, and upload the modified program.
