/*Problem:
 * Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k
	Given an integer array and a positive integer k, count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k.
	
	Examples:
	
	Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 2}, k = 3
	Output: 2
	There are 2 pairs with difference 3, the pairs are {1, 4} and {5, 2} 
	
	Input: arr[] = {8, 12, 16, 4, 0, 20}, k = 4
	Output: 5
	There are 5 pairs with difference 4, the pairs are {0, 4}, {4, 8}, 
	{8, 12}, {12, 16} and {16, 20} 
	
Algorithm:
	Sort the array arr
	Take two pointers, iand j, both pointing to 1st element
	Take the difference arr[j] ï¿½ arr[i]
	If value difference is K, increment count and move both pointers to next element
	if value difference > k, move l to next element
	if value difference < k, move r to next element
	return count

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
