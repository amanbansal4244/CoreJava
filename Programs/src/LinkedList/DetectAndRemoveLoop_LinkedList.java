/*We know that Floydï¿½s Cycle detection algorithm terminates when fast and slow pointers meet at a common point.
 * Detect Algorithm:	
 * 	Efficient approach for this problem would be Floyd's cycle detection algorithm,so steps for this algorithm would be:
		Use two pointer fastPtr and slowPtr and initialize both to head of linked list
		Move fastPtr by two nodes and slowPtr by one node in each iteration.
		If fastPtr and slowPtr meet at some iteration , then there is a loop in linked list.
		If fastPtr reaches to the end of linked list without meeting slow pointer then there is no loop in linked list (i.e fastPtr->next or fastPtr->next->next become null)
 * 
 *  Remove Algorithm:
 *  We also know that this common point is one of the loop nodes (2 or 3 or 4 or 5 in the above diagram).
 *  We store the address of this in a pointer variable say ptr2. Then we start from the head of the Linked List and 
 *  check for nodes one by one if they are reachable from ptr2. When we find a node that is reachable, 
 *  we know that this node is the starting node of the loop in Linked List and we can get pointer to the previous of this node.
